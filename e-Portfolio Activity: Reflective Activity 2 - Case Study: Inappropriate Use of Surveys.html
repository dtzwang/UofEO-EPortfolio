<h2>Reflection on the Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>

<p>The Cambridge Analytica case in 2018 exposed how seemingly harmless online surveys could be exploited to collect personal data from millions of Facebook users without their informed consent. The company used this information to build psychological profiles and target voters with personalized political advertisements, blurring the line between data analytics and manipulation. This incident demonstrated how the misuse of survey data can erode trust in technology companies and undermine democratic processes. From an ethical standpoint, it represented a clear violation of user autonomy and privacy. Socially, it damaged public confidence in digital platforms and raised concerns about the power of data-driven persuasion. Legally, it led to stronger enforcement of data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.</p>

<p>A more recent example is the use of “personality quizzes” on social media that secretly harvest user data for marketing purposes. These quizzes often request permissions beyond their stated purpose, allowing companies to infer sensitive information such as political views or purchasing habits. Professionally, these cases highlight the responsibility of computing professionals to design transparent data collection processes and ensure that survey instruments adhere to ethical standards. Responsible survey design must prioritize informed consent, minimal data collection, and accountability to prevent misuse and preserve public trust.</p>
