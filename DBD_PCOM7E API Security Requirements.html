<h2>API Security Requirements</h2>
<p>
We chose the Spotify Web API, which enables programmatic access to user data, playlists, and audio features using RESTful endpoints. For integration, data may be shared and processed in Python and stored as XML, JSON, or in SQL databases.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Authentication:</b> Require OAuth 2.0 for all API access. Do not store client secrets in code. Use secure token storage and refresh tokens regularly.</li>
  <li><b>Authorization:</b> Apply least privilege. Request only needed scopes, such as <code>user-read-private</code> or <code>playlist-read-private</code>. Never use broader scopes than necessary.</li>
  <li><b>Data Transmission:</b> Enforce HTTPS for all API calls to prevent interception of data or credentials.</li>
  <li><b>Input Validation:</b> Validate and sanitize all user input before sending to the API or storing in XML/JSON/SQL. Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.</li>
  <li><b>Rate Limiting:</b> Handle API rate limits gracefully in Python code. Monitor for and prevent abuse or excessive scraping.</li>
  <li><b>Data Privacy:</b> Do not log sensitive user information. Store only the data required, and avoid writing access tokens or personal details to disk or insecure files.</li>
  <li><b>Error Handling:</b> Catch exceptions in Python code to avoid leaking stack traces or sensitive error messages. Return generic errors to users.</li>
  <li><b>File Handling:</b> When saving as XML or JSON, use safe file permissions and avoid exposing files to the public web or network.</li>
  <li><b>Access Control:</b> Protect the Python application and database with strong passwords and restrict database access to trusted users/applications only.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By following these security measures, risks around unauthorized access, data leakage, and malicious scraping can be mitigated when sharing Spotify data between Python and file management systems.
