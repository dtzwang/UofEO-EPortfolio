<h2>Project Evaluation: Final Deliverable vs. Initial Proposal</h2>
<p>
Our initial project proposal in Unit 6 outlined a plan to design and implement a centralized relational database for ADR Logistics, a transportation firm with siloed and underutilized vehicle and maintenance data. The objective was to deliver a normalized SQL-based system for tracking vehicle status, maintenance records, sensor data, and trip histories using real logistics maintenance data. We planned to clean and organize data, define entities and relationships, ensure referential integrity, and deliver a system supporting real-time decision-making.
</p>
<p>
The final project in Unit 11 closely followed this original proposal but included a more detailed and practical approach, especially in the implementation and evaluation stages. Our team successfully developed a normalized database model in 3NF, built core tables (Vehicle, Maintenance, Trip_Info, Sensor_Data), and enforced primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity. The SQL schema we implemented matched the logical design, and we followed a robust pipeline: data exploration and cleaning in Python, format standardization, typecasting, and referential integrity checks during import.

Compared to the proposal, the final deliverable demonstrated more depth in legal compliance and security considerations. We documented GDPR compliance, including encryption, access controls, consent tracking, and audit logging. The final project also included more discussion of DBMS selection, outlining the trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL before justifying SQL as the right fit for ADR Logistics due to the need for structured, relational data and complex queries.

One of the key impacts on my professional development was gaining hands-on experience with end-to-end database design in a real-world transportation context. I learned to prioritize both business requirements and technical best practices, from normalization and schema design to compliance and data pipeline construction. Exposure to practical challenges, like preparing sensor data for relational storage and ensuring legal compliance, improved my ability to plan for scalability and secure data handling in the big data field.

Personally, this project reinforced the value of team communication and early stakeholder engagement. Each team member contributed different skills, from SQL implementation to documentation and data cleaning in Python. By comparing database models and considering both structured and flexible database technologies, I deepened my understanding of how to match data solutions to operational goals—a skill I now use in my current work with transportation data.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the project moved from a well-structured proposal to a functioning, legally compliant solution that met ADR Logistics’ requirements. The experience strengthened my technical and analytical skills and directly supports my ongoing professional development in the transportation industry, where data-driven decision-making and regulatory compliance are increasingly critical.
